## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Midnight blue (#2C3E50) to evoke a tech-focused, serious feel. The primary should be used sparingly to draw attention to what's important, like actionable items.
- Background color: Dark gray (#34495E) to support dark mode preference with a professional tone. Using a very desaturated variant of the primary color conveys a connection while not being overwhelming.
- Accent color: Teal (#1ABC9C) to highlight interactive elements and important information. Teal is an analogous color to blue, but a different shade so as to draw attention to where user actions are most required. And we all know users love teal.
- Clean and modern sans-serif fonts to ensure readability.
- Simple, line-based icons for a minimalist aesthetic.
- Grid-based layout for flexible widget arrangement and responsiveness.
- Subtle transitions and animations for a smooth user experience.
